# Welcome

This is the first post on my new academic homepage. I plan to use this space to share:

- Updates on my research projects.
- Tutorials on tools I use (like Svelte and Tailwind).
- Thoughts on recent papers in my field.

Stay tuned for more!

## Code Example

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
